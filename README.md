## Our Behaviours

“Talent is the multiplier. The more energy and attention you invest in it, the greater the yield”
— Marcus Buckingham, Author and business consultant.

We strongly believe that behaviors needed to exceed client expectations, hence we have 3 main conducts that make us stand out and that characterize our actions.

## Our Philosophy

We are a human-centered company which believes that motivated, passionate and reliable people are the roots to craft outstanding software solutions. Hence, every decision we are about to take actually reflects our philosophy. 

* Empathy with all the people involved with us;
* The whole team, including the client, should be aware of everything going on in the project, good or bad;
* Active and enthusiastic participation of our collaborators by enjoying moments together;
* Open environment, so our office’s doors welcome whoever wants to join us and exchange information, which leads both parts to enrich one another;
* No dress-code, so we all feel comfortable and free to express ourselves at work;
* Communication is one of the keys to success;
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
* Working software over comprehensive documentation;
* Client collaboration over contract negotiation;
* Responding to change over following a plan;
* Design for users not for stakeholders;
* Interactive prototypes over static documentation;
* What users need over what users want;
* User insights over assumptions;
* Pragmatism over user-centred design pureism;
* There is no such thing as better language or there is only one way to solve things. Each project is unique in tools and technologies;
* Community is one of the most important features of a programming language, keep this in mind when choosing one;
* Code should be deployed early and often;
* Code should be clean and tested so programmers feel happy and confident to work on;
* Code should have a good performance and always following the best practices.

## Our Commitments

* To keep a welcoming, safe, healthy workplace so we all get the best experiences from it. 
* To engage everyone in an open communication in the workplace.
* To invest on our collaborators to increase knowledge and provide benefits as much as we can, so we all live high-quality lives and we can unlock our potential.
* To fight for mutual respect among everyone in the company regardless of gender, political position, sexual orientation, religious choice and race, so we embrace one another’s uniqueness. We respect and actively encourage the contribution of every individual.
* To empower everyone to join talks and attend conferences, so we all share what we are about to learn.
* To encourage open source contributions, so both we and those we don't know grow together.
* To provide technical courses for everyone, either in-person or online, so we all see no barriers in increasing knowledge.
* To buy any technical book wanted/needed, so we all keep reading even outside the company.
* To keep transparency and honesty with our collaborators and clients.
* To offer as much coffee break as people wish, so we all work in our best.

# Why choosing Mobix

> “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.” 
― Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics. 

In each kind of relationship, you can learn what are the good practices that matter and those which are the basis of it to guarantee high-quality experiences for our main stakeholders: clients and collaborators. So, we are not only a software studio with experienced developers. We like to tailor outstanding solutions together with the client. We are not choosing projects where we are invaluable in a month and disposable in the next. We want to help products to last. For this reason we designed the standards we offer to our clients and our expectations towards them.

## Standards to our Clients

* Communication is the key, whenever the client needs it, we must attend to it, explaining and facilitating the understanding and the decision-making process;
* The whole scope of work should be clear, in order to avoid problems of interpretation, understanding, and expectations;
* We will listen effectively to our clients’ requests and promptly take the necessary actions to assist them;
* We will keep our clients informed of unexpected delays in service;
* We will greet and fulfill our responsibilities with our clients courteously and professionally;
* We always put ourselves into clients' position to tailor for them a suitable and excellent solution;
* We provide outstanding service that fits in the RATER standards. RATER stands for: Reliability, Assurance, Tangibles, Empathy, Responsiveness; 
* We will make the communication as fast as we can to attend the clients questions, especially if working with us remotely;
* In case the client is working remotely with us, we like to do conference calls daily to align our expectations and any other kind of information that we need to put the project on track;
* In order to deliver a high-quality experience both for clients and collaborators, the working hours allocated per employee are 32h/week;
* We will align the technical requirements of the project with the client for a kickstart, so we can prepare its expectations for the first deliveries and the other milestones of the project;
* We craft solution-oriented codes. How far we will be allowed to iterate is up to the client, but we value clients that want us to get involved in the product impact of software features;
* We want, primarily, to deliver end-to-end quality for software products. We built a software development process to guarantee that. And we get that the client’s context might emphasize other concerns;
* We work with project that lasts at least 3 months/14 weeks, because doing small projects over and over can make developers really good in setups and basic features, but larger projects have more interesting challenges that help developers become experts;
* Taking chances and building entire products on hunches can lead to idleness and demotivate developers (no one likes to develop things that never see the light of day). We focus on the good feeling that is to see your code being used - solving real problems for real people.

## Standards to our Collaborators

### Team Standards

> Our main tool is based on OKRs of John Doerr, aiming to make our collaborators more committed and accountable towards their tasks by having a long-term perspective. The team develops a physical scoreboard designed to create both public accountability and team engagement.

 ** KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD
> “People play differently when they’re keeping score. If you doubt this, watch any group of teenagers playing basketball and see how the game changes the minute scorekeeping begins. The kind of scoreboard that will drive the highest levels of engagement with your team will be one that is designed solely for (and often by) the players”. Chris McChesney, Co-author of the 4 disciplines of execution.

For this reason, we have a simple scoreboard that is updated weekly by our collaborators everytime they contribute to reach the goals.
