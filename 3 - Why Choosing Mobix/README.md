# Mobix Software Studio Playbook

# Why choosing Mobix

> “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.” 
― Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics. 

In each kind of relationship, you can learn what are the good practices that matter and those which are the basis of it to guarantee high-quality experiences for our main stakeholders: clients and collaborators. So, we are not only a software studio with experienced developers. We like to tailor outstanding solutions together with the client. We are not choosing projects where we are invaluable in a month and disposable in the next. We want to help products to last. For this reason we designed the standards we offer to our clients and our expectations towards them.

## Standards to our Clients

* Communication is the key, whenever the client needs it, we must attend to it, explaining and facilitating the understanding and the decision-making process;
* The whole scope of work should be clear, in order to avoid problems of interpretation, understanding, and expectations;
* We will listen effectively to our clients’ requests and promptly take the necessary actions to assist them;
* We will keep our clients informed of unexpected delays in service;
* We will greet and fulfill our responsibilities with our clients courteously and professionally;
* We always put ourselves into clients' position to tailor for them a suitable and excellent solution;
* We provide outstanding service that fits in the RATER standards. RATER stands for: Reliability, Assurance, Tangibles, Empathy, Responsiveness; 
* We will make the communication as fast as we can to attend the clients questions, especially if working with us remotely;
* In case the client is working remotely with us, we like to do conference calls daily to align our expectations and any other kind of information that we need to put the project on track;
* In order to deliver a high-quality experience both for clients and collaborators, the working hours allocated per employee are 32h/week;
* We will align the technical requirements of the project with the client for a kickstart, so we can prepare its expectations for the first deliveries and the other milestones of the project;
* We craft solution-oriented codes. How far we will be allowed to iterate is up to the client, but we value clients that want us to get involved in the product impact of software features;
* We want, primarily, to deliver end-to-end quality for software products. We built a software development process to guarantee that. And we get that the client’s context might emphasize other concerns;
* We work with project that lasts at least 3 months/14 weeks, because doing small projects over and over can make developers really good in setups and basic features, but larger projects have more interesting challenges that help developers become experts;
* Taking chances and building entire products on hunches can lead to idleness and demotivate developers (no one likes to develop things that never see the light of day). We focus on the good feeling that is to see your code being used - solving real problems for real people.

## Standards to our Collaborators

### Team Standards

> Our main tool is based on OKRs of John Doerr, aiming to make our collaborators more committed and accountable towards their tasks by having a long-term perspective. The team develops a physical scoreboard designed to create both public accountability and team engagement.

 ** KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD
> “People play differently when they’re keeping score. If you doubt this, watch any group of teenagers playing basketball and see how the game changes the minute scorekeeping begins. The kind of scoreboard that will drive the highest levels of engagement with your team will be one that is designed solely for (and often by) the players”. Chris McChesney, Co-author of the 4 disciplines of execution.

For this reason, we have a simple scoreboard that is updated weekly by our collaborators everytime they contribute to reach the goals.
