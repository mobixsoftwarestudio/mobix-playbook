## **Education**

> _“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest” - Benjamin Franklin._

We strongly believe that education makes us more agile when taking decisions. For this reason, we tailored our education cycle by using the following spaces:

* Bimonthly internal talks Every 15 days we gather some people to discuss a topic of interest. It's a moment for people to improve their public speaking skills, study about something they like and share their learnings and knowledge around the company. At the end of the presentation, beer and pizza are on us!
* Open office We believe that sharing knowledge and practices between organizations is an added value to exploit fully. For this reason, our office’s doors are open to anyone employed in other companies to work for a limited period with us and vice versa our collaborators are encouraged to share their learnings and information with other organizations.
* Courses and books

  > “Those people who develop the ability to continuously acquire new and better forms of knowledge that they can apply to their work and to their lives will be the movers and shakers in our society for the indefinite future.” ― Brian Tracy

As already stated, we value education in all its declination. Therefore, Mobix is committed to buying technical books and courses \(online and offline\) for anyone who claims for it, taking into consideration our possibilities.

* Conferences and events We strive to achieve our vision not only by tailoring software solutions but also by using the power of knowledge and networking to unlock human potential. Conferences and events are a precious source for meeting professionals and gaining knowledge to grow personally and professionally. During a 6-months period, people are encouraged to give back as much as they can, so Mobix will buy tickets for any technical conferences deemed worthy by the employees, and if one of ours approves a talk in a conference, whether it's local or international, she/he is granted a bonus for their further collaboration in sustaining the community we are a part of. Keeping an eye on conference submission deadlines helps everyone in doing so.
* English talks Since the majority of our clients are offshore, we raise the level of English throughout the company. For this reason, all the company’s communication is done in English. We also participate in international programs held by volunteering organizations like AIESEC, in order to welcome worldwide professionals which leads us to practice our English skills.
