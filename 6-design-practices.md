## Introduction

Having a clear process with templates and supporting materials ensures the consistency of our deliveries and guarantees the quality of our work.

The process does not need to be followed completely step by step, it adapts to different challenges with the same baseline so that the process is natural and consistent.

## Project Kickstart

To start any project we use a template structure that has the following topics below:

### Project Team

People are the key to any project, as well as effective communication within a good relationship between each other. Some ground rules are taken below:

* Set up the team's key roles and their respective positions and duties;
* Ask for the client a point of communication to handle decision-making;
* Connect with the project and the client's goals;
* Build a trustworthy relationship with the client's team.

### Meetings

Every meeting content has an agenda to build a single source of truth based on the meeting outcome, such as:

* Build up an agenda to guide the meeting
* Register meeting outcomes, following key points, discussed and their primary goals
* Document effectively all meetings and decisions along with the meeting recording video (if possible)

## Framework

We use the double diamond created by [British Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/news-opinion/double-diamond-universally-accepted-depiction-design-process/) as the basis of our process, which is divided into 4 phases described below:

#### 1. Immersion and Research

This is the first step of our process, where we diverge about the problem to be solved. During this phase, we understand the challenge we are facing, collect information about the project, discover the user's pains and needs.

The activities of this phase are described below:

* To collect and highlight the important points of the project;
* Share surveys regarding the challenge;
* Try to not re-do the wheel: Benchmarking of all competitors;
* Is there no competitor in the market? Use companies that have similarities.

The deliverables of this phase rely on:

* Briefing
* Customer Interview
* Ecosystem Map
* Benchmarking
* Strategic Analysis
* Quantitative and/or Qualitative Research

#### 2. Synthesis

Here we analyze the information from the previous phase and synthesize it, finding opportunities and understanding the problem in depth.

The activities of this phase are described below:

* Conduct an interview with real users so that the persona is really the user;
* When interviewing, do it with as many participants as possible, but remember that interviewing 1 user is better than none;
* Build flows to detect pain points faced by the user;
* The presentation must have research data and other dynamics included.

The deliverables of this phase rely on:

* Persona
* Empathy Map
* Value Canvas
* User Story Map
* User Journey
* Product Pitch

#### 3. Ideate

During this phase, we will explore possible solutions, understand their structure and evaluate them based on the challenge.

The activities of this phase are described below:

* Try to create a user case study to imagine how they will interact with your product;
* All built content must be done in a straightforward format is prone to be understood in words and sentences;
* Build up user flows as a quick way to map the main points between your customer and your product/service.

The deliverables of this phase rely on:

* Sitemap
* Carding Sorting
* Brainwriting
* User Flow

#### 4. Prototyping

During the last phase, the solution begins to come to life, where it will be evaluated, iterated, delivered, and documented.

The activities of this phase are described below:

* Guideline for prototyping:
  * No content (blank state);
  * Objective content;
  * Multiple contents (paging, scrolling);
  * Created/updated components in Figma;
  * Allow creating, reading, updating, and deleting information (CRUD);
  * Mobile-first version;
  * Use grid and standard spacing between elements;
  * Error and success messages;
  * Accessibility (contrast, description of images, etc).
    
#### Handoff

In the last step of the prototyping phase, we will record the behavior and business rules of the product, so that the information is registered and the development team can build the project in the same way as it was thought.

* The registration structure uses Scrum as a methodology. We register the contents in epics and stories;
* In this document, the corresponding screens must be linked using Figma;
* Versioning the project with the client is mandatory before releasing it to the development team;
* For good organization and maintenance, we must use components for items and describe their dependency throughout the project to avoid overwork;
* The acceptance criteria need always to be described in a single format for all stories (input, behavior, and output).

The deliverables of this phase rely on:

* Wireframe
* Design System
* High fidelity prototype
* Handoff document

### What skills should I have

#### Self Management

* Know your pain points and take actions to improve your skills;
* Get to know Mobix process and methodology;
* Know the workflow and organization practices (Playbook);
* Do only one thing at a time (as Agile says).

#### Communication

* Over-communication: speak always, all the time;
* Participate and discuss the strategy applied in a project;
* Always document all meetings and decisions;
* Listen to all interested parties involved;
* Share your questions early and often;
* Be transparent with everything you do: no need to be afraid when sharing your actions.

#### Research

* Understand the challenge and the needs of the project;
* Use the project delivery process with methods and references;
* Use all mandatory methods, being able to choose which step is optional based on the project timeline;
* Always seek face-to-face interaction with the user;
* User Testing;
* Always validate ideas.

#### Interface

* Always be consistent, worry about separating and naming in groups that make sense;
* Build and improve the design system for each project;
* Always take mobile-first;
* Build and validate functionality flows before developing wireframes;
* Prototype in low fidelity;
* Usability focus;
* Retrieve feedback from users;
* Always use the user language.
