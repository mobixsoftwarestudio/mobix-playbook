“Talent is the multiplier. The more energy and attention you invest in it, the greater the yield” — Marcus Buckingham, Author and business consultant.

We strongly believe that behaviors needed to exceed client expectations, hence we have 3 main conducts that make us stand out and that characterize our actions.

## Our Philosophy

We are a human-centered company which believes that motivated, passionate and reliable people are the roots to craft outstanding software solutions. Hence, every decision we are about to take actually reflects our philosophy.

* Empathy with all the people involved with us;
* The whole team, including the client, should be aware of everything going on in the project, good or bad;
* Active and enthusiastic participation of our collaborators by enjoying moments together;
* Open environment, so our office’s doors welcome whoever wants to join us and exchange information, which leads both parts to enrich one another;
* No dress-code, so we all feel comfortable and free to express ourselves at work;
* Communication is one of the keys to success;
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
* Working software over comprehensive documentation;
* Client collaboration over contract negotiation;
* Responding to change over following a plan;
* Design for users not for stakeholders;
* Interactive prototypes over static documentation;
* What users need over what users want;
* User insights over assumptions;
* Pragmatism over user-centred design pureism;
* There is no such thing as better language or there is only one way to solve things. Each project is unique in tools and technologies;
* Community is one of the most important features of a programming language, keep this in mind when choosing one;
* Code should be deployed early and often;
* Code should be clean and tested so programmers feel happy and confident to work on;
* Code should have a good performance and always following the best practices.
