# Hiring and On-Boarding Process

Our hiring process is based on open spots and people’s professional and personal development. Hence, we designed a process based on education, learning by doing and career plan. 

## Stages

The 4 stages of the hiring process aim at measuring technical prowess, communication skills, and management abilities for UX designer and Developer positions: 

1. Application form through the career section of our website to appraise the ownership of technical skills, as well as the alignment to our values and behaviours;
2. Interview: here we have an open conversation with the candidate, that's the best way we found so far to evaluate the professional experience. At the same time, this step focuses on the ability to understand the technical process and common difficulties that can happen along the way;
3. Task: in this step, we send the specs for a project that needs to be delivered in a week. At this stage, we mainly evaluate abilities, skills and good practices. According to the needs, we may require one more task to fulfill to evaluate candidates’ qualities, such as problem-solving skills.
4. Group assessment: when we need to appraise leadership, team-work and management qualities, we usually invite the candidates to a group assessment.

At the end of the process, candidates are shortlisted and each new collaborator starts the on-boarding process to acquire knowledge organizationally and technically.
