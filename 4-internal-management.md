# Internal Management

> “Collaboration is a key part of the success of any organization, executed through a clearly defined vision and mission and based on transparency and constant communication” - Dinesh Paliwal.

We use different tools for communication and management inside Mobix.

## Management

#### **Asana**

It’s a web and mobile application designed that we use to help teams organize, track, and manage projects and tasks in one tool. Teams can create projects, assign work to teammates, specify deadlines, and communicate about tasks directly in Asana. It also includes reporting tools, file attachments, calendars, and more.

#### **GSuite**

It's a set of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products developed by Google, G Suite comprises Gmail, Hangouts, Calendar, and Currents for communication; Drive for storage; Docs, Sheets, Slides, Keep, Forms, and Sites for productivity and collaboration;

#### **Harvest**

It’s a simple time tracking, fast online invoicing, and powerful reporting software that simplifies employee timesheets and billing. Harvest collates the raw timesheet data into a visual summary of where our team’s time is going.

#### **Forecast**

It’s a project and resource management software that helps us to automate operations, empower people, and leverage insights to drive businesses.

#### **Doodle**

It’s an online scheduling tool that we use to quickly and easily find a date and time to meet within our team, but also with multiple people. So, Doodle aggregates the responses and tells us which option works best for everyone.

## Communication

#### **Slack**

It offers many IRC-like features, including persistent chat rooms \(channels\) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. We use it to communicate within the organization and the teams about working topics. Content, including files, conversations, and people, are all searchable within Slack.

#### **Whatsapp**

WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, images, audio, or video. We use it for informal communications both in private and in groups.

## OKRs

We structured an organization that thrives by setting OKRs as the basis of our work.

Objectives and key results \(OKR\) is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

As explained by John Doerr:

> "The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it."

OKRs comprise an objective—a clearly defined goal—and one or more key results—specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKR is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a 0-100% scale or any numerical unit \(ex: dollar amount, %, items, etc.\). Objectives should also be supported by initiatives, which are the plans and activities that help to achieve the objective and move forward the key results. OKRs are typically calendar-based.

An “OKR cycle” is often quarterly, but it can also be monthly, because tracking them regularly is like "working out”—you have to do it a repeatedly and regularly to make measurable progress in business goals throughout company levels for high output management. So, we chose to track the progresses quarterly.
