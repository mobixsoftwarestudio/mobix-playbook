# Mobix Software Studio Playbook

# Development Practices

## Standards

### Git Flow

### Boilerplates

To kickstart a project at Mobix, we need to evaluate the project complexity as well as the type of architecture. 

On regular projects we develop, we usually don't start from scratch - which means we have our patterns set up and we keep our standards for each project we make. Thus, we can keep maintanance and also share with our developer community our practices and always seeking for improvements.
