# Everyday Tools
> “Collaboration is a key part of the success of any organization, executed through a clearly defined vision and mission and based on transparency and constant communication” - Dinesh Paliwal.

## Internal

### **GSuite**

- Gmail, Google Meet and Calendar for official communication;
- Drive for storage in the cloud: Docs, Sheets, Presentations and Forms;
- Apps Scripts for automating a few things in forms;

### **Harvest**

It’s a simple time tracking, fast online invoicing, and powerful reporting software that simplifies employee timesheets and billing. Harvest collates the raw timesheet data into a visual summary of where our team’s time is going.

### **Doodle**

It’s an online scheduling tool that we use to quickly and easily find a date and time to meet within our team, but also with multiple people. So, Doodle aggregates the responses and tells us which option works best for everyone.

### **Slack**

We use it to communicate within the organization and the teams about working topics. Content, including files, conversations, and people, are all searchable within Slack.

### **Whatsapp**

We use it for informal communications both in private and in groups.
