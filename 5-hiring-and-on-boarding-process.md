The 4 stages of the hiring process aim at measuring technical prowess, communication skills, and management abilities for UX designer and Developer positions:

* [x] Project: in this step, we send the specs for a project that needs to be delivered in a week. At this stage, we mainly evaluate abilities, skills and good practices. According to the needs, we may require one more task to fulfill to evaluate candidates’ qualities, such as problem-solving skills.
* [x] Group assessment: when we need to appraise leadership, team-work and management qualities, we usually invite the candidates to a group assessment. This final step can be applied using pair programming, soft skills challenge, technical presentations.
